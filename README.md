# PhotoCaptionGenerator
Learning a simple Photo Caption Generator in PyTorch.

I just wanted to make some practice with a challenging NLP task in PyTorch. This _just-for-fun_ project is a step-by-step _partial_ re-implementation of [https://machinelearningmastery.com/develop-a-deep-learning-caption-generation-model-in-python/](https://machinelearningmastery.com/develop-a-deep-learning-caption-generation-model-in-python/), which was developed in Keras.

## Some highlights
* Transfer Learning with Pre-Trained InceptionV3 Photo Feature Extractor
* Pre-Trained Word vectors (GloVe)
* Argmax Search vs Beam Search for caption generation
